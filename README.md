🖐️ Hand Gesture Volume Control using OpenCV and Pycaw
Control your system's master volume using nothing but your fingers — no touch, no buttons, just gestures!

https://github.com/your-username/hand-gesture-volume-control

📸 Project Overview
This Python-based project allows users to control the system volume by moving their fingers in front of a webcam. It uses computer vision techniques via OpenCV and hand tracking through a custom HandTrackingModule. The system volume is adjusted based on the distance between the user's thumb and index finger.

✨ Features
📷 Real-time hand tracking using a webcam

🔉 Volume control by measuring the distance between thumb and index fingertips

🎚️ Visual volume bar and percentage overlay

⚡ Smooth FPS performance display

👋 Instant visual feedback when the hand gesture is recognized

🔧 Technologies Used
OpenCV – For image processing and video stream handling

MediaPipe / Custom HandTrackingModule – For hand and landmark detection

PyCaw – To control system volume on Windows

Math, NumPy, time – For calculations and performance tracking

▶️ How It Works
Starts webcam capture and initializes hand detection.

Detects landmarks for thumb tip (ID 4) and index fingertip (ID 8).

Measures the distance between these two points.

Maps this distance to a system volume level using interpolation.

Sets the system volume in real time.

Displays a visual volume bar and FPS counter on the screen.🧰 Installation & Usage
🛠 Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Webcam

Windows OS (due to Pycaw dependency)
 Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install opencv-python pycaw comtypes numpy
📦 Clone and Run
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hand-gesture-volume-control.git
cd hand-gesture-volume-control
python main.py
Press q to quit the application.

💡 Tips
Ensure good lighting for more accurate hand tracking.

Keep your hand in the camera frame.

Distance range: Closer fingers = lower volume, farther apart = higher volume

❗ Limitations
Currently supports only Windows (due to Pycaw)

Limited to one-hand gesture tracking

May require tweaking in different lighting or hand angles
